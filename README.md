In this module, I used tiingo library to get the Apple closing price data from **May 12, 2016-May 10 2021.** Tiingo is a financial data platform that makes high quality financial tools available to all.

Tiingo has a REST and Real-Time Data API, which this library helps you to access.

Then, I used LSTM model to train and predict first on both train and test dataset. Next, I used LSTM model to predict closing price for the 30 days
